PAYG tax rates effective 1 July 2018 have been used and average Fees and Charges are included. Tax, benefit and \nMedicare Levy calculations are approximate, and assume no other taxable income is received. HELP repayments and taxation surcharges \nare excluded.\nMeal entertainment: The Meal Entertainment benefit has an annual cap limit of $2,650 and will appear as a reportable item on your \nPayment Summary each year. This cap is separate from the FBT cap limits for everyday living expenses.\nGeneral advice warning: The information about the Maxxia Wallet is general in nature and does not take into account your personal \nobjectives, needs and circumstances. You should consider the appropriateness of the information having regard to your personal \ncircumstances and consider the Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) before making any decision.

Maxxia Pty Ltd acts as authorised representative of EML Payment Solutions Limited ABN 30 \n131 436 532, AFSL 404131 as distributor of the Maxxia Wallet.\nNovated lease: The estimated potential tax benefit is based on the assumption that you would have paid for the lease from your post-tax \nsalary (as opposed to salary packaging those payments from your pre-tax salary, or a combination of your pre and post-tax salary). The \nestimated annual benefit will vary depending upon salary, employment circumstances, selected benefits and applicable tax treatment. This \nexample assumes that benefits to the value of $9,010 (excluding GST) are already packaged and that the novated lease is in addition, a \n4-year lease term, an annual distance travelled of 15,000kms and a 35% residual value. The base value of the vehicle for FBT purposes is \n$33,606. The total amount financed is $32,017 including on-road costs. The estimated annual operating costs are $14,287 which includes \nestimates of fuel, maintenance, registration, comprehensive insurance and fleet management fee. GST of 1/11th is payable on your ECM \ncontributions.\nImportant information: This general information doesn’t take your personal circumstances into account.
